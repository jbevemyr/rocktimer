#
# This file is intended to be appended to /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
# (or you can copy the relevant lines manually).
#
# It allows other RockTimer devices on the Wi‑Fi network to sync time
# from the Pi 4.

# Allow clients from the RockTimer subnet
allow 192.168.50.0/24

# Optional: act as a local time source even if internet is unavailable
# (use a higher stratum so it won't override real NTP when available)
local stratum 10
